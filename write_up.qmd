## Introduction & Motivation

Climate change will drastically affect the livelihoods of many in novel and heterogeneous ways. This is not news. Despite this awareness, individuals often perceive the effects of climate change distantly, both in time and space ([Markman, 2018](https://hbr.org/2018/10/why-people-arent-motivated-to-address-climate-change)). Thus, current issues seem more pressing than the longer-term complexities and uncertainties surrounding the impending crisis. This mindset is especially persistent in North America, where the concern of climate change is split between ideological differences ([Pew Research, 2013](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/09/27/u-s-stands-out-as-among-the-least-concerned-about-climate-change/#:~:text=Only%20financial%20instability%20conjures%20a,compared%20with%2057%25%20of%20Democrats.)) 

Regardless of personal belief preferences, climate change continues to increase the intensity and rate of such disasters, and the risk of disaster personally impacting every individual increases. At what point will we begin to act in accordance with the provided information of increasing risks? What will it take for both individuals and communities to mitigate and/or adapt to such risks? 

This study explores these questions through agent-based modeling (ABM). An ABM is built to explore alternative adaptation strategies in a community increasingly at risk for mass climate disasters, such as wildfires. This case study is largely inspired by the January and February 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, CA, which took 29 lives and engulfed over 23,000 acres and 16,000 homes ([MacCarthy & Richter, 2025](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained)). The rising global temperatures have created a breeding ground for the ignition and spread of wildlfires. One study estimated that climate change made L.A.’s fires 35% more likely to occur ([source](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-increased-the-likelihood-of-wildfire-disaster-in-highly-exposed-los-angeles-area/)). In such a case, individuals did not migrate nor develop thorough disaster adaptation strategies. This fits more generally into trends of disaster and migration, where migration only increases through extreme destruction of the built environment ([Price et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50630-4)). 

Through building and evaluating an ABM to represent this social scenario, the researchers are able to explore alternative behaviors. Thus, we may be able to analyze the conditions that are required to enact long-term adaptive strategies.

## Model

In this section, we detail the model parameters and dynamics.

### Parameters

-   $N$: Number of agents

-   $\bar{k}$: Average degree

-   Network structures (Small world, Minority-Majority)

-    $p_{A0},  p_{L0}, p_{M0}$: Initial prevalence of individuals in adaptive, legacy, and migrated states

-   $f_{A}, f_{L}, f_{M}$: Fitness values of adaptive behavior, legacy behavior, and migrated behavior

-   $T$: Total number of time steps

-   $p(D)$: Probability of disaster at each time step

-   $L$: Learning strategy

-   $u$: Utility value of holding some behavior

-   $r$: Adoption rate

### Dynamics 

1.  At t = 0, Initialization of migrated, legacy, and adaptive prevalence, $u=f_{A}, f_{L}, f_{M}$
2.  For each time step from t=0 to T:
    1.  **Disaster Simulation***: Draft #1* = Probabilistic with $p(D)$, *Draft #2* = $p(D)$ impacted by $p_A$,

        1.  If disaster occurs $D = 1$, else, $D=0$

    2.  **Disaster Response**:

        1.  If $D=1$: $u_{i_{t+1}} = u_{i_{t}}-d$
        2.  $u_{i_{t}}=u_{i_{t+1}}$
        3.  If $u_{i_t} == 0$, migrate

    3.  **Agent Learning Mechanisms (for each agent)**

        *Pre-interaction checking...*

        1.  If agent has migrated, skip
        2.  If agent is performing adaptive behavior,
            1.  If \# neighbors.behavior \>= 1/2 \* \# neighbors: (Considering this to be majority cooperation), increase utility by cooperation payoff value
            2.  Else, continue
        3.  Select teacher based on $L$
        4.  If $u(teacher)>u(agent)$
            1.  Agent adopts teacher behavior with some adoption rate $r$
        5.  Interact with teacher: Compare current utility value, and update behavior and future utility value
        6.  Count total individuals taking on certain behavior
        7.  Loop

    4.  **Stopping Condition:** Run until fixation

### Computational Experiments: 

-   Vary learning strategy

-   Vary initial parameters

-   Vary cooperation payoffs

-   Vary network structures

-   Vary disaster situation

```{r}
# Initialization 
N <- 20 # Agents
k <-  5 # Mean degree
f_A, f_L, f_M <- 1.1, 1, 0.8 # Fitness of various behaviors 
p_A, p_L, p_M <- 0.2, 0.7, 0.1 # Initial prevalence of individuals of different behaviors (so, there should be 4 adaptive, 14 legacy, and 2 migrated)
p_D <- 0.05 # On average, there is a disaster every 50 steps, with the p(D) = 5% 
r <- 0.6 # learning rate 


```
