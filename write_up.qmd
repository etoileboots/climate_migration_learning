Introduction & Motivation

While the Earth's climate is in constant flux, current climate change is proceeding at rates unobserved over many recent millennia as a result of human activities largely triggered by the industrial revolution ([IPCC, 2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/climate-change-2021-the-physical-science-basis/technical-summary/C7CCEAD271B10F328C6E50C03A0F4F02). Such changes come with a few symptoms, including but not limited to global temperature rise, ice sheet melting, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Such weather events include increased record high temperatures, intense rainfall, and wildfire uncertainty ([USGCRP, 2017](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1900/ML19008A410.pdf)).

With knowledge of present changes, multi-level and multi-national institutions are working to enhance their climate-resilience programs for successful adaptation to the unprecedented state we live in. Successful climate adaptation starts with an understanding of various risks and possible uncertainties. In this paper, risk is defined as decision making under known outcome probabilities and state space, and uncertainty being decision making under unknown outcome probabilities and state space ([Knight](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref35), [1921](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref35); [Keynes, 1921](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref33); [Johnson et al, 2022](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref30)). Thus, the task of facilitating community climate-adaptation turns into the task of proper management of both the known and unknown probabilities regarding various climate-change effects. The consequences of inaccurate prediction of risk and a disregard for uncertainty can be dire. This study aims to understand the consequence of inaccuracies in climate-risk-uncertainty prediction through looking one climate effect and response: adaptation strategies to increased frequency and volatility of wild fires.

The context for this model is largely inspired by the January and February 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, CA, which took 29 lives and engulfed over 23,000 acres and 16,000 homes ([MacCarthy & Richter, 2025](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained)). A recent attribution study estimated that climate change made L.A.’s fires 35% more likely to occur ([Barnes et al., 2025](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-increased-the-likelihood-of-wildfire-disaster-in-highly-exposed-los-angeles-area/)). Despite clear signals, many residents did not migrate or adopt long-term adaptation strategies. This is likely a result of inaccurate representation of the true risk of disaster in the area, which costed the community lives, infrastructure, and money.

An accurate prediction of risk and accounting for uncertainty may have sparked earlier community adaptation efforts such as the building of a fire-adapted community (FAC), increased public awareness, and defensible space planning. It's clear that the older schema of wildfire planning is insufficient in the accelerating onset of such disasters. Thus, this study focuses on the problem of accurate disaster prediction and mitigation strategies. The central research questions are as follows:

1.  How does a community adapted to a certain of wildfire risk and uncertainty re-adapt or collapse with changes to such risk and uncertainty?
2.  How does the rate of change from a previous to new wildfire risk and uncertainty affect the ability for a community to adapt?

To study these two main research questions, the researchers build an agent based model (ABM) to simulate the evolution of legacy, adaptive, and migratory behaviors under disaster probability.

This plot provides an illustrative example of the network structure for a small number of agents. In full simulations, the model typically uses `N = 1000` agents.

Agents reside in a network and at any given time step can have one of three behavioral states:

-   **Legacy (L):** no proactive mitigation

<!-- -->

-   **Adaptive (A):** engages in risk-reducing action
-   **Migrated (M):** has exited the system semi-permanently

In addition to a current behavior, every agent also has a set of attributes that determine their social status, vulnerability, and learning strategies. The properties of each agent is listed below:

-   $\theta_i$: A social threshold for agent i to learn a new behavioral strategy (how many neighbors need to be performing a certain behavior to consider adopting this behavior)

-   $\kappa_i$: A personal adaptation cost for agent i to transition to an adaptive behavior

-   $v_i$: Current vulnerability of agent i (determined by their behavior and neighborhood)

### General Simulation Overview

![Figure 1. Flowchart of simulation dynamics.](images/simulation_flowchart.png)

Migrated (M): has exited the system semi-permanently

The model incorporates socio-environmental feedback: disaster frequency and severity evolve as a function of population-wide behavior. The central research question is the following: Under what conditions can individual's learn to cooperate in order to reduce community vulnerability under varying uncertainty with environmental risk?

Disaster Dynamics

At each time step $t$, a binary disaster event is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with a specified disaster probability $\pi_t$:

$$
D_t \sim \text {Bernoulli}(\pi_t)
$$

If $D_t = 1$, a disaster occurs, and its severity $\delta_t$ is sampled from a normal distribution:

$$
\delta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_t, \sigma_t)
$$

This severity value will directly impact agent vulnerability.

Vulnerability Dynamics

Each agent $i$ has a vulnerability score $v_i^t \in [0, 1]$. If $v_i^t \geq v_{\text{mig}}$, the agent transitions to the migrated state:

$$
\text{If } v_i^t \geq v_{\text{mig}}, \text{ then } b_i^{t+1} = M
$$

Individual Impact

If $D_t = 1$, vulnerability increases. Adaptive agents incur reduced damage due to mitigation:

$$
v_i^{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
v_i^t + \delta_t & \text{if } b_i^t = L \\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - \gamma) & \text{if } b_i^t = A
\end{cases}
$$

Community Protection Effect

Let $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denote the neighbors of agent $i$, and define a threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$.

We define a protection indicator:

$$
\text{CommProtect}_i^t =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \dfrac{|\{j \in \mathcal{N}(i) \mid b_j^t = A\}|}{|\mathcal{N}(i)|} \geq \theta \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Then, vulnerability update with community protection includes a community protection variable $c$:

$$
v_i^{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
v_i^t + \delta_t & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 0 \land b_i^t = L\\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - c) & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 0 \land b_i^t = A\\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - c) & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 1 \land b_i^t = L \\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - c - \gamma) & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 1 \land b_i^t = A
\end{cases}
$$

This reflects both direct and spillover benefits of adaptation.

Behavioral Transitions

Social Learning

Each non-migrated agent $i$ adopts adaptive behavior $A$ if the fraction of neighbors with behavior $A$ exceeds their threshold $\theta_i$:

$$
\frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_i|} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \mathbb{1}[b_j^t = A] \geq \theta_i
$$

In this case, $b_i^{t+1} = A$ with probability $r$. For the case of adopting an adaptive behavior, however, there is an extra barrier to cross into such behavior required to break inertial behavior. This barrier can be thought as the colloquial "barrier to entry", where adaptive behaviors often require increased initial input from an individual. In the case of fire prevention strategies, this might include financial or time-based costs for the individual to create such defensible space. This cost is modeled via an MCMC, where in addition to consider the adoption of a behavior with $\theta_i$, such adopting must be vetted with another sampling scheme $b$.

#### Stochastic Transitions via Mutation

To introduce behavioral drift and exploration, at each time-step:

-   With small probability $\epsilon$, any agent may randomly transition to any other behavior $b \in \{L, A, M\}$

<!-- -->

-   This allows recovery from behavioral homogeneity and exploration of alternatives

## Experiments

### Experiment 1.a). Impact of Disparities in Expected vs Actual Disaster Occurrence Probability *(Risk)*

**Guiding Question:** How does varying differences in the expected versus actual probability of disaster (i.e. the rate of disaster occurrence) impact community survival dynamics?

**Real World Analogue:** A community is adapted to expect and manage an annual wild-fire season, but is instead, subjected to quarterly wildfires ($\mu_{A_{scale}}=4$).

### Experiment 1.b) Impact of Disparities in Expected vs Actual Disaster Occurrence Standard Deviation *(Uncertainty)*

**Guiding Question:** How does adjusting the uncertainty in the probability of disaster from an equilibrium (adapted) state impact community survival dynamics?

**Real World Analogue:** A community is adapted to manage an annual wildfire season during a specific month of the year (eg. summer), but instead, is experiencing "freak" wildfires at unexpected months.

| Simulation Type | Parameters of Interest |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Severe Overestimation of Disaster Occurrence Deviation | $\sigma_{A_{scale}} < 0.5$ |
| Mild Overestimation of Disaster Occurrence Deviation | $0.5 <\sigma_{A_{scale}} < 1$ |

| Severe Underestimation of Disaster Occurrence Deviation | $\sigma_{A_{scale}} > 1.5$ |

### Experiment 2.a) Impact of Disparities in Expected vs Actual Disaster Severity Mean *(Risk)*

**Guiding Question:** How do differences in the expected and actual mean severity of a disaster impact community survival?

**Real World Analogue:** A community is adapted to manage wildfires of an average burn area of 50 acres, but is instead experiences wildfires burning over 200 acres, burning down homes and vital infrastructure.

| Simulation Type | Parameters of Interest |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Severe Overestimation of Disaster Severity | $D_{\mu_{A_{scale}}} < 0.5$ |
| Mild Overestimation of Disaster Severity | $0.5 <D_{\mu_{A_{scale}}} < 1$ |
| Mild Underestimation of Disaster Severity | $1 <D_{\mu_{A_{scale}}} < 1.5$ |
| Severe Underestimation of Disaster Severity | $D_{\mu_{A_{scale}}} > 1.5$ |

### Experiment 2.b) Impact of Disparities in Expected vs Actual Disaster Severity Standard Deviation *(Uncertainty)*

**Guiding Question:** How does changing the uncertainty in the severity of a disaster impact community survival dynamics?

**Real World Analogue:** A community is adapted to manage wildfires of an average burn area of 50 acres and a specific level of community damage, but is instead experiences successive wildfires of 20 burn acres, 200 burn acres, and 500 burn acres.

| Simulation Type | Parameters of Interest |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Severe Overestimation of Disaster Severity Deviation | $D_{\sigma_{A_{scale}}} < 0.5$ |
| Mild Overestimation of Disaster Severity Deviation | $0.5 <D_{\sigma_{A_{scale}}} < 1$ |
| Mild Underestimation of Disaster Severity Deviation | $1 <D_{\sigma_{A_{scale}}} < 1.5$ |
| Severe Underestimation of Disaster Severity Deviation | $D_{\sigma_{A_{scale}}} > 1.5$ |

### Experiment 3: Impact of Rate of Disaster Progression on Community Survival

**Guiding Question:** How does the rate of disaster onset impact community survival?

**Real World Analogue:** It would be intuitive to expect that a community given 200 years to adapt to a new disaster paradigm would be less likely to collapse (through total migration) than one that was given 5 years.

| Simulation Type          | Parameters of Interest     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Instantaneous Transition | $\lambda = 0$              |
| Rapid transition         | $1 \leq \lambda \leq 15$   |
| Medium-length transition | $16 \leq \lambda \leq 50$  |
| Gradual transition       | $51 \leq \lambda \leq 200$ |
