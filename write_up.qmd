Introduction & Motivation

<<<<<<< HEAD
While the Earth's climate is in constant flux, current climate change is proceeding at rates unobserved over many recent millennia as a result of human activities largely triggered by the industrial revolution ([IPCC, 2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/climate-change-2021-the-physical-science-basis/technical-summary/C7CCEAD271B10F328C6E50C03A0F4F02). Such changes come with a few symptoms, including but not limited to global temperature rise, ice sheet melting, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Such weather events include increased record high temperatures, intense rainfall, and wildfire uncertainty ([USGCRP, 2017](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1900/ML19008A410.pdf)).

With knowledge of present changes, multi-level and multi-national institutions are working to enhance their climate-resilience programs for successful adaptation to the unprecedented state we live in. Successful climate adaptation starts with an understanding of various risks and possible uncertainties. In this paper, risk is defined as decision making under known outcome probabilities and state space, and uncertainty being decision making under unknown outcome probabilities and state space ([Knight](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref35), [1921](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref35); [Keynes, 1921](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref33); [Johnson et al, 2022](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/form-of-uncertainty-affects-selection-for-social-learning/18B581D90A78CE094194C24C59757F5B#ref30)). Thus, the task of facilitating community climate-adaptation turns into the task of proper management of both the known and unknown probabilities regarding various climate-change effects. The consequences of inaccurate prediction of risk and a disregard for uncertainty can be dire. This study aims to understand the consequence of inaccuracies in climate-risk-uncertainty prediction through looking one climate effect and response: adaptation strategies to increased frequency and volatility of wild fires.
=======
When it comes to climate change, there are a couple things for certain. First, the climate is changing. Second, such changes will force speedy adaptation to survive in novel situations. This shift in climate has been spurred by human activity and led to globally increases in overall surface temperatures and uncertainty surrounding the strength and frequency of different weather conditions.

Despite the clear knowledge of probable future impacts, communities and individuals often respond to climate-related risks with delayed response and denial. The effects of climate change are considered distantly, both in time and space (Markman, 2018). Such behavior may be best understood when considering human decision making under uncertainty, as opposed to risk. While these terms are often used interchangeably, in this paper, we continue with defining risk as decision making under known outcome probabilities and state space, and uncertainty being decision making under unknown outcome probabilities and state space (Knight, 1921; Keynes, 1921; Johnson et al, 2022).

The context for this model is largely inspired by the January and February 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, CA, which took 29 lives and engulfed over 23,000 acres and 16,000 homes ([MacCarthy & Richter, 2025](https://www.wri.org/insights/los-angeles-fires-january-2025-explained)). A recent attribution study estimated that climate change made L.A.’s fires 35% more likely to occur ([Barnes et al., 2025](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-increased-the-likelihood-of-wildfire-disaster-in-highly-exposed-los-angeles-area/)). Despite clear signals, many residents did not migrate or adopt long-term adaptation strategies. This is likely a result of inaccurate representation of the true risk of disaster in the area, which costed the community lives, infrastructure, and money.

<<<<<<< HEAD
An accurate prediction of risk and accounting for uncertainty may have sparked earlier community adaptation efforts such as the building of a fire-adapted community (FAC), increased public awareness, and defensible space planning. It's clear that the older schema of wildfire planning is insufficient in the accelerating onset of such disasters. Thus, this study focuses on the problem of accurate disaster prediction and mitigation strategies. The central research questions are as follows:

1.  How does a community adapted to a certain of wildfire risk and uncertainty re-adapt or collapse with changes to such risk and uncertainty?
2.   How does the rate of change from a previous to new wildfire risk and uncertainty affect the ability for a community to adapt?

To study these two main research questions, the researchers build an agent based model (ABM) to simulate the evolution of legacy, adaptive, and migratory behaviors under disaster probability.
=======
This study explores these questions through an agent-based model (ABM) simulating a social network under increasing threat of climate-related disasters, focusing particularly on the case of wildfires. The context for this model is largely inspired by the January and February 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, CA, which took 29 lives and engulfed over 23,000 acres and 16,000 homes (MacCarthy & Richter, 2025). A recent attribution study estimated that climate change made L.A.’s fires 35% more likely to occur (Barnes et al., 2025). Despite clear signals, many residents did not migrate or adopt long-term adaptation strategies.

This behavior is consistent with broader patterns: migration or adaptive behaviors often occurs only after extreme destruction, rather in the anticipation of growing risk (Price et al., 2024). In other words, people tend to adapt reactively rather than proactively.

To examine the underlying dynamics of this delayed response, the ABM simulates agents with different behavioral strategies (adaptive, legacy, and migrated), varying degrees of disaster risk, social learning strategies, and human-environment interactions.

This plot provides an illustrative example of the network structure for a small number of agents. In full simulations, the model typically uses `N = 1000` agents.

Agents reside in a network and at any given time step can have one of three behavioral states:

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   **Legacy (L):** no proactive mitigation

<!-- -->

-   **Adaptive (A):** engages in risk-reducing action
-   **Migrated (M):** has exited the system semi-permanently

In addition to a current behavior, every agent also has a set of attributes that determine their social status, vulnerability, and learning strategies. The properties of each agent is listed below:

-   $\theta_i$: A social threshold for agent i to learn a new behavioral strategy (how many neighbors need to be performing a certain behavior to consider adopting this behavior)

-   $\kappa_i$: A personal adaptation cost for agent i to transition to an adaptive behavior

-   $v_i$: Current vulnerability of agent i (determined by their behavior and neighborhood)

### Global Properties 

#### Simulation set-up (not key): 

-   $N$: Number of agents in the system

-   $T$: Simulation steps

-   $p_{L_0}$: Proportion of legacy agents at $t=0$

-   $p_{A_0}$: Proportion of adaptive agents at $t=0$

-   Network type + Rewiring probability

-   $[\theta_{min}, \theta_{max}]$: The lower and upper bounds for proportion of neighbors required to be performing a certain behavior.

-   $v_L$: Initialized vulnerability of legacy behavior individuals

-   $v_A$: Initialized vulnerability of adaptive behavior individuals

#### Social Learning Parameters 

-   $r$: Base probability of adapting a specific behavior when their social conditions are met

-   $\epsilon$: Probability of random mutation from one behavior to another

#### Disaster Dynamics Probabilities

##### Rate of Disaster

-   $P(\mu_E)$: The expected probability of disaster

-   $\sigma_E$: The initial deviation (uncertainty) in disaster occurrences

##### Intensity of disaster 

-   $D_{\mu_E}$: Initial/Expected disaster severity mean

-   $D_{\sigma_E}$: Initial/Expected disaster severity standard deviation

#### Vulnerability Dynamics

-   $v_{mig}$: Threshold of vulnerability required for agent to migrate

-   $c$: Reduction in vulnerability for agents under neighborhood community protection

-   $\gamma$: Individual reduction in vulnerability from adaptation

-   Community protection threshold (proportion of adaptive neighbors needed for protection) \*\* need to find a good variable for this

### Experimental Properties

##### Rate of disaster evolution: 

-   $\lambda$: The rate of change from previous to new disaster probability

##### Probability of disaster 

-   $\mu_{A_{scale}}$: How many scales off the expected/equilibrium probability of disaster is from the actual probability of disaster

-   $\sigma_{A_{scale}}$: How many scales off from the expected standard deviation of probability of disaster the actual probability of disaster is

##### Intensity of disaster 

-   $D_{\mu_{A_{scale}}}$: How many scales off the actual severity of the disaster damage is

-   $D_{\sigma_{A_{scale}}}$: How many scales off the standard deviation of the actual severity of the disaster damage is

### General Simulation Overview

Migrated (M): has exited the system semi-permanently

The model incorporates socio-environmental feedback: disaster frequency and severity evolve as a function of population-wide behavior. The central research question is the following: Under what conditions can individual's learn to cooperate in order to reduce community vulnerability under varying uncertainty with environmental risk?

Disaster Dynamics

At each time step $t$, a binary disaster event is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with a specified disaster probability $\pi_t$:

$$
D_t \sim \text {Bernoulli}(\pi_t)
$$

If $D_t = 1$, a disaster occurs, and its severity $\delta_t$ is sampled from a normal distribution:

$$
\delta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_t, \sigma_t)
$$

<<<<<<< HEAD
This severity value will directly impact agent vulnerability.
=======
Both disaster frequency and damage are behavior-dependent, where the frequency of agents performing either a legacy or adaptive behavior will determine the level of uncertainty with both parameters. This is motivated by the general idea that more adaptive agents will lead to more successful disaster mitigation and resilience, resulting in an environmental state of more certainty (e.g., consistency in annual fires of some general degree and month of burn). Alternatively, continuing legacy, or non-adaptive behaviors will lead to more uncertainty with disaster damage and increased probability of disaster (e.g., "freak" fires during unexpected month and level of damage).

Let $p_L^t = \frac{|\{i \mid b_i^t = L\}|}{N}$ be the proportion of legacy-behaving agents

Disaster probability $\pi_t$ is given by a sigmoid function to model nonlinear tipping points with legacy behaviors leading to larger probabilities of disaster.$\pi_t = \frac{1}{1 + \exp[-k(p_L^t - \tau)]}$

Additionally, the disaster damage uncertainty evolves with the mean staying the same, and the tails with a larger proportion of legacy individuals

$\mu_t = \mu_0$

$\sigma_t = \sigma_0 + \beta \cdot p_L^t$

As legacy behavior increases, both the frequency and unpredictability of disasters rise.
>>>>>>> e7b5650e2559f1dff9331c078e5150aa0b1219bf

Vulnerability Dynamics

Each agent $i$ has a vulnerability score $v_i^t \in [0, 1]$. If $v_i^t \geq v_{\text{mig}}$, the agent transitions to the migrated state:

$$
\text{If } v_i^t \geq v_{\text{mig}}, \text{ then } b_i^{t+1} = M
$$

Individual Impact

If $D_t = 1$, vulnerability increases. Adaptive agents incur reduced damage due to mitigation:

$$
v_i^{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
v_i^t + \delta_t & \text{if } b_i^t = L \\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - \gamma) & \text{if } b_i^t = A
\end{cases}
$$

Community Protection Effect

Let $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denote the neighbors of agent $i$, and define a threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$.

We define a protection indicator:

$$
\text{CommProtect}_i^t =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \dfrac{|\{j \in \mathcal{N}(i) \mid b_j^t = A\}|}{|\mathcal{N}(i)|} \geq \theta \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Then, vulnerability update with community protection includes a community protection variable $c$:

$$
v_i^{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
v_i^t + \delta_t & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 0 \land b_i^t = L\\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - c) & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 0 \land b_i^t = A\\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - c) & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 1 \land b_i^t = L \\
v_i^t + (\delta_t - c - \gamma) & \text{if } \text{CommProtect}_i^t = 1 \land b_i^t = A
\end{cases}
$$

This reflects both direct and spillover benefits of adaptation.

Behavioral Transitions

Social Learning

Each non-migrated agent $i$ adopts adaptive behavior $A$ if the fraction of neighbors with behavior $A$ exceeds their threshold $\theta_i$:

$$
\frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_i|} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \mathbb{1}[b_j^t = A] \geq \theta_i
$$

In this case, $b_i^{t+1} = A$ with probability $r$. For the case of adopting an adaptive behavior, however, there is an extra barrier to cross into such behavior required to break inertial behavior. This barrier can be thought as the colloquial "barrier to entry", where adaptive behaviors often require increased initial input from an individual. In the case of fire prevention strategies, this might include financial or time-based costs for the individual to create such defensible space. This cost is modeled via an MCMC, where in addition to consider the adoption of a behavior with $\theta_i$, such adopting must be vetted with another sampling scheme $b$.

#### Stochastic Transitions via Mutation

To introduce behavioral drift and exploration, at each time-step:

-   With small probability $\epsilon$, any agent may randomly transition to any other behavior $b \in \{L, A, M\}$
